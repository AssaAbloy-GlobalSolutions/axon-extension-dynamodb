## Axon DynamoDB Extension

The Axon Framework DynamoDB Extension extends the Axon Framework for building event-driven microservice systems.
Based on Domain Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing principles, this extension provides essential building
blocks such as Aggregate factories, Repositories, Command, Event and Query Buses, and an Event Store.

This DynamoDB extension streamlines infrastructure management, letting you concentrate on your business
functionality. The repository adds an extension to the Axon Framework that uses DynamoDB for persistence,
serving as an EventStorageEngine (for use with an EventStore) and TokenStore. Enjoy a well-structured
application with the Axon Framework DynamoDB Extension.
